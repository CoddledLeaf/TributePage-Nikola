                <p id="about-text">During his life Tesla allowed himself few close friends, one of which was the writer Mark Twain. He was also impractical in financial matters and quite an eccentric, driven by compulsions and a germ phobia. Yet he certainly rates amongst the top geniuses of all time. In fact it has been said of Tesla that he invented everything. An exaggeration, but during his life he made a truly enormous number of discoveries and had over 700 patents to his name.
                <br><br>However there were some of these discoveries that were more important to him. Tesla summed up his own life bay saying: "I continually experience an inexpressible satisfaction from the knowledge that my polyphase system is used throughout the world to lighten the burdens of mankind and increase comfort and happiness, and that my wireless system, in all its essential features, is employed to render a service to and bring pleasure to people in all parts of the world."</p>

                            <p>In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved the performance of the company.</p>

                            <p>In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as the Continental Edison Company. He began working in a new industry by installing indoor lighting resources. His company had several divisions, and he worked in the section of the company that was responsible for lighting systems. At this company, he improved his electrical engineering prowess. The management team noticed his abilities and soon introduced him as part of the team that would produce dynamos and motors. Following this, Tesla moved to New York in the USA.</p>

                            <p>Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 dollars to solve a problem, but Edison never paid.</p>

                            <p>After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company. In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed to help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass media who sought his solutions.</p>

                            <p>After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various public demonstrations, where he would light up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geissler_tube">Geissler tubes</a> to impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade trying to come up with new solutions for lighting</p>

The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</p>

The assistant medical professional evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to coronary complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the acquisition of his belongings, John G Trump was called in to evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who worked for the state, which was held in custody. Following a three day investigation, a Trumps report concluded that was nothing that would demonstrate a hazard in unfriendly circumstances.</p>
